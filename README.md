I am convinced that fundamental analysis should dive deeper into a specific industry. 
Fortunately, I interned at Haitong Security and had a relatively clear insight into the new-energy industry, especially the photovoltaic and hydrogen energy industries. Therefore, I tried to deploy data analysis skills in this industry. 

## General Objective:
The long-term ambition is to build an industry-specific knowledge graph so that models can make decisions more systematically. In the short term, the first step to getting close to this ambition is to collect more data and convert these data into a somehow structured format. According to my experience in the last internship, projects published online, news published via various sources(official media, Financial website, etc.), government policies, official statistic factors(e.g., installed capacity), and announcements of companies are all critical data sources. 

## Current Specific objective - Project related data:
1. Crawl projects data on https://news.solarbe.com/xiangmu/
2. Use NLP techniques to extract Keywords in those projects

## Finished objectives:
1. Crawl projects data on https://news.solarbe.com/xiangmu/
